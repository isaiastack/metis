# Jupiter Metis  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SigwoTechnologies/jupiter-gravity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SigwoTechnologies/jupiter-gravity)

We’re all familiar with using our favorite chat apps and we often just assume we can trust them with our personal information. It’s not until our private life is compromised do we suddenly reconsider how we’re doing things. 

Next generation chat application metis improves your privacy by defaulting to locally encrypt all communications before sending any message.

With Jupiter Metis, you always have the power over your privacy and what, if anything, is shared. No central servers store any information about you, your account, or conversations. There’s no signup required and participating in group chats is as simple and secure as it gets.

Metis runs on the blockchain and is 100% encrypted with AES encryption. By using blockchain to talk, you’re protecting your communications and keeping your chats private!
